Hello all, I attended The Art Institute of Pittsburgh Online division for 3 years to learn interactive media and web design.  It has now been 3 years since I last attended and just as long since I last wrote any code.  I learned HTML, CSS3, a little bit of Bootstrap and other coding languages. I also learned how to use many of the Adobe Applications like Dreamweaver and Illustrator.  Now I just want to get back to coding and find that I have forgot alot.  Now I do not know where to start.  So much has changed.
